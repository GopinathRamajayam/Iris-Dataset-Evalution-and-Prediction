# Iris-Dataset-Evalution-and-Prediction using Python

Evaluation and prediction of Iris Dataset by some algorithms through SK-LEARN and Pandas libraries

1. Loading the Dataset 
2. Data Visualization
3. Creating Validation Dataset
4. Building Models
5. Making Predictions


Models Used: (Mixture of Linear and Non Linear algorithms) 

1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Name  : Mean      Std
LR    : 0.966667 (0.040825)
LDA   : 0.975000 (0.038188)
KNN   : 0.983333 (0.033333)
CART  : 0.975000 (0.038188)
NB    : 0.975000 (0.053359)
SVM   : 0.981667 (0.025000)

K-Nearest Neighbors performs better when compared with other algorithms. KNN has accuracy score of 98% for training and 90% for testing.
